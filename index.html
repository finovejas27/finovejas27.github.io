    <div class="smalltext width25">This is not a metaphorical question. It does not suggest that the Internet is dysfunctional. It asks what happened to the Internet after it stopped being a possibility.</div>

    <div class="width25"></div>
    <div class="smalltext">The question is very literally whether it is dead,</div>

    <div class="smalltext width50">The Internet is now more potent than ever. It has not only sparked but fully captured the imagination, attention and productivity of more people than at any other point before. Never before have more people been dependent on, embedded into, surveilled by and exploited by the web. It seems overwhelming, bedazzling and without immediate alternative. The Internet is probably not dead. It has rather gone all-out. The Internet is not everywhere. Even nowadays when networks seem to multiply exponentially, many people have no access to the Internet or donâ€™t use it at all. And yet, it is expanding in another direction. It has started moving offline.</div>
